              <p>
                The design of this website was inspired by modern, minimalistic portfolios. I wanted to create a clean and professional look while showcasing my engineering projects and skills. I used tools like Figma to sketch out the layout and color schemes before diving into development.

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-jackoneal-yellow-900">Tech Stack</h2>
              <p>
                This website is built using <strong>Astro</strong>, a modern static site generator that allows me to use React components where needed while keeping the site fast and lightweight. For styling, I used <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, which made it easy to create a responsive and visually appealing design.

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-jackoneal-yellow-900">Challenges</h2>
              <p>
                One of the biggest challenges was integrating 3D models using <strong>Three.js</strong>. I had to ensure that the models loaded correctly and performed well on different devices. Debugging issues with server-side rendering (SSR) in Astro was another learning experience, especially when working with browser-specific APIs like <code>window</code> and <code>document</code>.

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-jackoneal-yellow-900">Future Improvements</h2>
              <p>
                In the future, I plan to add more interactive elements, such as animations and more blogs where I can share my engineering projects in detail. I also want to optimize the site further for performance and accessibility.
